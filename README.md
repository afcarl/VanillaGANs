# VanillaGANs
This code implements a vanilla GAN, as described in the original paper by [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). It implements both the generator and the discriminator as fully connected feedforward networks, without using any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or Theano. Both implementations are heavily derived from [Denny Britz's excellent tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/). 

This source code was originally developed as the final project for the course CS674: Mathematical Topics In AI &amp; Optimization (Fall 2016) at Rutgers.
